        <p>The Koldevi mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by Koldevi (“Koldevi”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>
        <p>By consenting to Koldevi’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of Koldevi through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list.

Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.</p>
